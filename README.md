To run:
1. Download all files
2. Organize according to note below.
3. Load the html file.
4. Enjoy

Note: lib folder must be stored one level up from where html and javascript files are stored or the html file must be edited to reflect the new folder
hierarchy in order for everything to work properly.

Note: in order to load image/texture files from local machine. The privacy.file_unique_origin setting in the about:config page of firefox must be changed set to true.
Make sure to change it back to its default after testing is complete to avoid opening security holes. On a side note, this ability to load from the local
machine is also available in Chrome albeit a different solution.
